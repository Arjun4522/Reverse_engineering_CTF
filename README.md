# Reverse_engineering_CTF

Reverse engineering is a process that involves in-depth analysis of the code, structure, and functionality of executable software components. It is often used to understand how a program works, to identify vulnerabilities or security flaws, to create interoperable software, or to learn from existing systems.

Here's an ELF file that you have to reverse engineer to find out the 'Secret Phrase'. Happy Hacking!
